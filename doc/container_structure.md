# Container Structure

The file structure for DSN and OLB files is almost similar, DSN files only include a few more streams. The following list gives an overview of which streams are contained and where they are placed.

In front of each entry is a specifier placed that shows of which type the entry is. [D] represents a directory and [S] a stream (file). Directories are also bold. Cursive texts represent names that are provided by the designer. E.g. *Package Name 1* might become `NE555`.

## `NetBundleMapData`

The `NetBundleMapData` stream was introduced in later file format versions and contains the association of wires and busses to a net group. This structure is identified with `0x67`.
